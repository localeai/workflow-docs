# Email

The Email App is a built-in app provided by Locale that helps users send emails to recipients directly from their workflows. This app offers a single action designed to facilitate email communication with ease.

## Actions

### Send Email

The "Send Email" action allows you to send emails to specified recipients. You can use static email addresses, comma-separated values, or dynamic data variables to populate the recipient list. Additionally, you can customize the subject and body of the email, choosing between plain text or custom HTML formats.

#### How to Use

1. **Set Up the Action**: Add the "Send Email" action to your workflow.
2. **Configure Recipients**: Enter the email addresses of the recipients. You can use static addresses or data variables to include addresses from previous nodes.
3. **Set Subject**: Define the subject of the email.
4. **Compose Body**: Choose the body type (plain text or HTML) and compose the email content.

### Example

1. **Add Action**: Drag and drop the "Send Email" action into your workflow canvas.
2. **Configure Recipients**: Enter email addresses separated by commas, or use data variables to include dynamic addresses. For example:
   ```json
   hello@locale.ai, {{ previousNode.data.email1 }}, {{ previousNode.data.email2 }}
   ```
3. **Set Subject**: Define the subject of the email. For example:
   ```plaintext
   Welcome to Locale!
   ```
4. **Compose Body**:
   - **Plain Text**:
     ```plaintext

     Welcome to Locale! We're excited to have you on board.
