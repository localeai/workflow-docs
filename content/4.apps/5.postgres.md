# PostgreSQL

The PostgreSQL integration in Locale allows users to seamlessly connect their PostgreSQL databases to Locale, enabling the creation of dynamic and data-driven workflows.

## Connecting PostgreSQL to Locale

To integrate your PostgreSQL database with Locale, follow these steps:

1. **Provide Connection Details**: Enter the following information to establish the connection:
   - **Display Name**: A name for the connection in Locale.
   - **Host Address**: The address of your PostgreSQL server.
   - **Port**: The port number of your PostgreSQL server.
   - **Database**: The name of the database you want to connect.
   - **Username**: The username for accessing the database.
   - **Password**: The password for the specified username.
2. **Additional Configurations** (optional):
   - **Enable SSL**: Toggle this option if your database requires SSL.
   - **Bastion Host Configurations**: Provide details if your database connection requires a bastion host.
3. **Firewall Configurations**: Ensure to whitelist Localeâ€™s IP addresses if your database is behind a firewall.

## Triggers

### New Row is Added

The "New Row is Added" trigger allows you to execute a workflow when a new row is added to your PostgreSQL database. This trigger runs an SQL query at a specified frequency and initiates the workflow for each new row found.

#### How to Use

1. **Set Up the Trigger**: Add the "New Row is Added" trigger to your workflow.
2. **Configure SQL Query**: Provide an SQL query that returns the rows to be monitored. Ensure the query includes all necessary information and at least one column with a unique value.
   - If no single column is unique, configure the query to create a unique key column using a combination of two columns.
3. **Primary Key Column**: Specify the unique or primary key column.
4. **Frequency of Execution**: Choose the frequency at which the query should run to check for new rows.
   - **Fixed Frequency**: Select from predefined intervals (e.g., every 1 minute to every 4 hours).
   - **Cron Schedule**: Define custom schedules using cron syntax. Examples:
     - `* * * * *` (Every minute)
     - `0 0 * * *` (At midnight every day)
     - `0 */2 * * *` (Every 2 hours)

### Example Configuration

- **SQL Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT id, name, email, created_at FROM users WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
  ```
- **Primary Key Column**: `id`
- **Frequency**:
  - **Fixed Frequency**: Every 5 minutes
  - **Cron Schedule**: `*/5 * * * *` (Every 5 minutes)

Once the trigger is set, you can select a row from the query response to use it for further workflow configurations.

## Actions

### Run SQL Query

The "Run SQL Query" action allows you to execute SQL queries on your PostgreSQL database. This action can be used to insert, update, delete, or fetch data.

#### How to Use

1. **Set Up the Action**: Add the "Run SQL Query" action to your workflow.
2. **Write SQL Query**: Enter the SQL query you want to execute. You can inject data variables from previous nodes to customize the query.

### Example

1. **Add Action**: Drag and drop the "Run SQL Query" action into your workflow canvas.
2. **Write SQL Query**: Use data variables to dynamically insert values. For example:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO orders (user_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES ({{ previousNode.data.user_id }}, {{ previousNode.data.product_id }}, {{ previousNode.data.quantity }})
   ```
