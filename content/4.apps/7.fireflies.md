## Introduction

Fireflies.ai is a powerful call recording and transcription tool that automatically joins online meetings and calls to record and transcribe conversations.

## Integration

To use Fireflies.ai in your Locale workflows, you'll need to set up the integration by following these steps:

### Obtaining the API Key

1. Log in to your account at [app.fireflies.ai](https://app.fireflies.ai)
2. Navigate to the Integrations section
3. Click on Fireflies API

Once connected, you'll be able to use Fireflies.ai triggers and actions in your Locale workflows.

## Triggers

### New Call Completed

The "New Call Completed" trigger initiates workflows automatically when a call is finished in Fireflies.ai.

#### Trigger Data
When a call is completed, the trigger provides essential information about the call, including:

- Participants
- Date and Time
- Host
- Summary
- Transcript

This data can be used in subsequent steps of your workflow to automate tasks, generate reports, or trigger follow-up actions.

## Actions

### Fetch Call Transcripts

The "Fetch Call Transcripts" action enables users to retrieve specific call transcripts and details by providing the call ID.

## Using Fireflies.ai in Your Workflows

### Creating a Workflow with the "New Call Completed" Trigger

1. Start a new workflow in Locale.
2. Select "Fireflies.ai" as the trigger app.
3. Choose "New Call Completed" as the trigger event.
4. Configure any additional settings if required.

#### Example Workflow

1. Trigger: New call completed in Fireflies.ai
2. Action: Send a summary email to all participants
3. Action: Create a task in your project management tool for any action items identified

### Using the "Fetch Call Transcripts" Action

1. Add the Fireflies.ai app to your workflow.
2. Select the "Fetch Call Transcripts" action.

#### Example Workflow

2. Combine the Fireflies.ai integration with AI actions in Locale to analyze call transcripts and extract valuable insights.
3. Set up automated follow-up tasks or reminders based on the content of your calls.
4. Create different workflows for different types of calls (e.g., sales calls, team meetings, customer support) to automate specific processes for each.
