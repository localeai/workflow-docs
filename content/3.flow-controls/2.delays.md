# Delay Node

The Delay Node in Locale allows you to pause the execution of your workflow for a defined duration. This feature is particularly useful for scheduling tasks, spreading out actions over time, and ensuring that certain processes occur at the right moment.

## Key Features

- **Pause Execution**: Temporarily halt the workflow for a specified period.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Define delays in various formats, including seconds, minutes, and hours.
- **Time-Based Control**: Use delays to control the timing of actions within your workflow.

## How to Use the Delay Node

### Adding the Node

1. **Drag and Drop**: Add the Delay Node to your workflow by dragging it from the node palette to the workflow canvas.
2. **Configure Delay**: Click on the node to open the configuration panel where you can set the delay parameters.

### Configuring the Delay

1. **Delay Duration**: Specify the delay duration in seconds, minutes, or hours. For example, you can set a delay of 10 minutes.

### Example Configuration

- **Delay Duration**: 10 minutes

## Example Workflow

Let's consider an example where you want to send follow-up emails to customers 24 hours after they receive their initial email:

1. **Trigger Node**: An initial email is sent to a customer.
2. **Delay Node**: Add a Delay Node to pause the workflow for 24 hours.
3. **Action Node**: After the delay, send a follow-up email to the customer.

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Initial Email Sent**: Connect the trigger node that indicates an initial email has been sent.
2. **Add Delay**: Configure the Delay Node to pause for 24 hours (`1440 minutes`).
3. **Follow-Up Email**: Connect the Delay Node to the action node that sends the follow-up email.
