### Step 5: Leverage AI and Create Agentic Workflows

Our AI features are designed to make your workflows smarter and more autonomous. You can:

- **Automate Decision-Making**: Use AI to make decisions based on data patterns and historical trends.
- **Extract Data**: Extract data from content like emails, messages and documents.
- **Generate Content**: Use AI to generate summaries and content like emails, messages and notifications.

### Step 6: Implement Human-in-the-Loop Processes

Locale's event-driven actions allow you to create workflows that integrate human decision-making effectively. For example:

- **Slack Integration**: Send a Slack message with interactive buttons. Locale can listen for button click events or user replies to proceed with the next steps based on user input.
- **Zendesk Integration**: Create Zendesk tickets and listen for their resolution or closure. This allows human agents to intervene and make decisions as necessary.

#### Example of an Agentic Workflow with Human-in-the-Loop

1. **Trigger**: A new lead is added to the CRM (e.g., Salesforce).
2. **AI Analysis**: The AI analyzes the lead's data to predict the likelihood of conversion based on historical data.
3. **Decision Making**: If the lead has a high probability of conversion, the workflow automatically sends a personalized follow-up email. If the probability is low, it sends a Slack message to the sales team for review.
4. **Human Interaction**: The sales team reviews the lead and clicks a button in Slack to approve or reject follow-up actions.
5. **Event Listening**: Locale listens for the button click event and proceeds with the appropriate action.

By implementing such workflows, Locale enables businesses to automate complex processes with minimal human oversight, while still incorporating necessary human decisions, thus exemplifying the principles of agentic workflows.
