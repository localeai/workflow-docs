# Debugging a Workflow

Locale offers extensive functionality to examine the data flowing into and out of a node, along with any helpful logs or errors. This capability is crucial for debugging and ensuring your workflows operate smoothly.

## Configuration Panel Overview

When configuring a node, the section at the bottom of the configuration panel on the right provides detailed information about the input, output, errors, and logs. This information is essential for understanding how data moves through your workflow and for identifying and resolving any issues.

### Browsing Input and Output Data

In the configuration panel, you can browse through:

1. **Input Data:** This section displays the data coming into the node from all the connected nodes. It helps you verify that the incoming data is as expected and is being passed correctly from previous nodes.
2. **Output Data:** This section shows the data being output by the current node. It allows you to see the results of the node's actions and ensure that the data is being processed correctly.

### Viewing Errors and Logs

Errors and logs are crucial for diagnosing issues within your workflow:

1. **Errors:** The errors section lists any errors encountered during the execution of the node. This includes API response errors, connection timeouts, and other issues that might prevent the node from functioning correctly. For example, if your API responds with a 404 error or if a JDBC connection times out, these errors will be displayed here.
2. **Logs:** The logs provide a detailed record of the node's operations, which can help you trace the workflow execution and pinpoint where things might be going wrong.

## Example Workflow Debugging

Let's consider a scenario where you are debugging a database query node:

1. **Configuration Panel:** Open the configuration panel for the `Query Database` node.
2. **Input Section:** Check the input section to ensure that the correct data is being passed into the node from previous nodes (e.g., `webhook`, `slack_1`, `zendesk_1`).
3. **Output Section:** Review the output section to see the results of the database query. Verify that the query is returning the expected data.
4. **Errors Section:** If the node is not functioning correctly, check the errors section. You might see errors like "API Response Error: Your API responded with 404" or "JDBC Connection Timeout: Your query took way longer than expected and the query has been terminated."
5. **Logs Section:** Use the logs to trace the execution of the node and identify any issues that are not immediately apparent from the input, output, or errors.
